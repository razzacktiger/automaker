Let me search for Kanban-related files specifically:

Now let me also look at the KanbanColumn component to understand the current layout:

Now I understand the current implementation. The feature request is to:
1. Reduce the width of the "In Progress" column to 1 column (remove the double width)
2. Remove the masonry layout (2-column CSS columns layout)

Currently:
- `isDoubleWidth` prop controls whether the column is `w-[37rem]` (double width) or `w-72` (single width)
- When `isDoubleWidth` is true, it uses `columns-2` CSS to create a masonry-style layout

The fix involves:
1. Changing the column to not use double width anymore
2. Removing the masonry layout

Let me modify the `board-view.tsx` to not pass `isDoubleWidth` for the in_progress column, and also update the `kanban-column.tsx` to have proper styling:

Now let me also clean up the `kanban-column.tsx` to remove the `isDoubleWidth` prop since it's no longer used:
🔧 Tool: Edit
The changes have been made. Let me verify that there are no TypeScript errors by checking if the code compiles correctly:
🔧 Tool: Bash
The TypeScript errors are from an unrelated example file (`example/page.tsx`), not from my changes. The kanban-column.tsx and board-view.tsx files compile without errors. Let me verify this specifically:
🔧 Tool: Bash
These errors are just configuration issues with running TypeScript outside of the project's build context (JSX flags, path aliases, etc.). The project should work fine with its normal build process (Next.js handles all of this). Let me check to ensure the project builds correctly using the project's build system:
🔧 Tool: Bash
The build errors are unrelated to my changes - they're about a missing `@anthropic-ai/sdk` module in a test route and Google Font fetching issues. My changes to `kanban-column.tsx` and `board-view.tsx` are valid.

Let me verify the changes are correct by reading the modified files:

The changes are complete:

**Summary of changes:**

1. **`app/src/components/views/kanban-column.tsx`**:
   - Removed the `isDoubleWidth` prop from the interface and component parameters
   - Simplified the width class to always be `w-72` (single column width)
   - Removed the masonry layout (`columns-2 gap-2 [&>*]:break-inside-avoid [&>*]:mb-2`)
   - Now uses simple `space-y-2` for vertical card spacing in all columns

2. **`app/src/components/views/board-view.tsx`**:
   - Removed the `isDoubleWidth={column.id === "in_progress"}` prop from the KanbanColumn component

The "In Progress" column now has the same width (w-72, approximately 18rem/288px) as all other columns and displays cards in a single vertical stack without the 2-column masonry layout.

Now let me mark this feature as verified using the UpdateFeatureStatus tool:

The feature has been implemented successfully.

## Summary

**Feature:** Reduce width of In Progress column to 1 column, no masonry

**Changes made:**

1. **`app/src/components/views/kanban-column.tsx`**:
   - Removed the `isDoubleWidth` prop entirely
   - All columns now have uniform width (`w-72` ≈ 288px)
   - Removed the masonry 2-column CSS layout (`columns-2`)
   - All columns now use simple vertical stacking with `space-y-2`

2. **`app/src/components/views/board-view.tsx`**:
   - Removed `isDoubleWidth={column.id === "in_progress"}` prop

**Result:** The "In Progress" column is now the same width as all other columns (Backlog, Waiting Approval, Verified) and displays cards in a single vertical column instead of a 2-column masonry layout.

The feature has been marked as `waiting_approval` for your manual review and commit.✅ Verifying implementation for: reduce width of in progress to 1 column no masonry
